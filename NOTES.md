## Day 1
- Do not move iterator after finding a whole word, because some words can have common parts. "oneight" contains both "one" and "eight".
## Day 2
- Remember to iterate correctly (from 0 or from 1, depending on excercise)
- Make sure to spell R G B correctly (your mistake was to spell R B G accidentally)

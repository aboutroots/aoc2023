## Day 1
- Do not move iterator after finding a whole word, because some words can have common parts. "oneight" contains both "one" and "eight".
## Day 2
- start iterating correctly (from 0 or from 1, depending on excercise)
- spell R G B correctly (your mistake was to spell R B G accidentally)
## Day 3
-  -index in python will start index from the end! This might be not what you want
- Check indexes for off-by-one error
- properly parse values from the edges of the map
